## Huffman-Text-Compression
#Naive Implementation of Huffman Coding for text compression   
I made this for my Data Structures and Algorithms project. I implemented the compression algorithm to work on text based files.   
Any text file that is input as text into the program should be compressed using the algorithm and output as the compressed codes.    
  
#Limitations  
Decoding hasn't been implemented.   
Some extreme cases have been overlooked.   
Different types of input files are not supported.
